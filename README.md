## FAQ

#### If the Animakit has any relation to React Animation?
No. Animakit is separate collection of the components. All components use React but implement an animation on their own way.

#### Do I need to install the whole Animakit to use one of the components?
No. All components are independent and developed for separate use.

#### Could I request to add one more component to Animakit?
Yes. Feel free to leave an [issue](https://github.com/askd/animakit/issues) ;)
